# Damak-Recreation-Centre

The CourseWork(CW) deals with developing a desktop application using C# with an  object-oriented approach and uses Visual Studio 2019 IDE. The build application,"  Damak Recreation Centre System" was a system that could be used by admin or staff. The admin has to enter a password, "admin" to use the system as admin whereas staff  has to enter the password, "staff" to use the system as being staff. In the system, the admin has the privilege of the editing ticket price rate which would  be used by the system to calculate the total ticket fee of a visitor. On the other hand, staff  has the privilege of adding visitors in the system with their details in the CSV file which  would be shown in the datagridview table directly. Staff can also generate a daily report  based on category and total visitors and a weekly report based on day, total visitors, and  total earning in bar graph form
